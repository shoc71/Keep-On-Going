        Where the actual game loop is running.
        Everything game related is defined in scene.
        Scene is initialized by running Program (in main
        which is outer scope) with the screen size and scene.
        At this point in time, scene is run as MenuScene.

        Everything relating to calling the scene is called here, such as
        input, update, and render while the game is running.

        If the game isn't running, then in the final loop (or the loop when
        the game is told to close by various means), self.running is set to
        false and the scene is changed to nothing. Then the game is safe to
        close.

        This is also where inputs are collected before they are sent to
        the inputs for scene.

        Finally, this is where FPS is set and where the display is updated.
