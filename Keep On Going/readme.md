# How to Play

You will always be moving in one direction, so it's better to jump, leap, and make your way through the obstacles.

* Press the "up arrow", "space" or "w" on the keyboard to jump. Press and Hold the jump button to continue the jump.
* Avoid the ${\color{red}RED}$ as it will stop you, and send you back to the beginning of the level or your last checkpoint.
* Reach the ${\color{cyan}CYAN}$ to win and continue to the next level.
* Touch the ${\color{lightgreen}LIGHT \space GREEN}$ for a checkpoint, allowing you to come back here if ${\color{red}STOPPED}$

* If you ever feel that the pacing is too quick, you can change the speed and difficulty in the options!

Complete all the levels that you can (with some secrets too. hehe). But Don't Stop Now.
