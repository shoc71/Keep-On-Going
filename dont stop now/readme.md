# How to Play

* Hit the "up arrow", "space" or "w" on the keyboard for a jump. Hold the jump button to continue the jump
* Avoid the ${\color{red}RED}$ as it will stop you 
* Reach the ${\color{cyan}CYAN}$ to win and continue to the next level
* Touch the ${\color{lightgreen}LIGHT \space GREEN}$ for a checkpoint, allowing you to come back here if ${\color{red}STOPPED}$

Complete all the levels that you can, while some are harder than others. But Don't Stop Now.
