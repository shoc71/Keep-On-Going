# How to Play

You will always be moving in one direction, so it's better to jump, leap, and make your way through the obstacles.

* Press the "up arrow", "space" or "w" on the keyboard to jump. Press and Hold the jump button to continue the jump.
* Avoid the ${\color{red}RED}$ as it will stop you, and send you back to the beginning of the level or your last checkpoint.
* Reach the ${\color{cyan}CYAN}$ to win and continue to the next level.
* Touch the ${\color{lightgreen}LIGHT \space GREEN}$ for a checkpoint, allowing you to come back here if ${\color{red}STOPPED}$

Complete all the levels that you can (with some secrets too. hehe). But Don't Stop Now.
